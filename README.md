Project for Hacks and Crafts by MLH

## Inspiration
We’ve all encountered websites and applications that make us want to throw our devices across the room in frustration. Fundamentally, a good user interface enables users to complete the task that they came to the website to do with ease and without confusion. On top of it, the title of this hackathon, "Hacks and Crafts" was also an essential factor that led us to design this amazing site with fantastic UI and animations.

## About Project-Lavish
It's a fully responsive site for a Resort Agency where you can view the types of suites they offer, the facilities they offer, and the activities that are popular. The site also has a testimonial section attached. It has a unique UI with certain animated interaction that intuitively draws the user’s attention to a certain element. Moreover, it has a minimalistic design that is liked by the majority of the users.

## How we built it
We built it using only HTML and CSS along with some UI and animation libraries such as Bootstrap and AOS library. The use of Javascript is almost equivalent to negligible.

## Challenges we ran into
Time was the greatest challenge that we ran into. We developed this site, starting from scratch within two days only. On top of it, making the site responsive was another challenge for us as you know, CSS can be a hell of a nightmare sometimes (^_^).

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of developing a fully responsive site, starting from scratch within only two days of time with great UI and attractive animations . This was the greatest accomplishment for us. Teamwork, proper planning, and execution made this possible.

## What we learned
We learned some new concepts such as CSS flexbox and CSS grids, more about responsive behavior of sites, and proper documentation of code.

## What's next for Project-Lavish
Next, we're planning to add a pricing section for different types of suites and payment gateway along with a user login/sign-up page so that we can release it up and running in the market.
